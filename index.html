						<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
					</header><center>
					


The benefits of art, both producing and experiencing it, are well known.<br/> 
For one, producing art is a form of self-expression. Artists can say with their art what they
cannot say with their words. Psychologically, it is proven that art, in any form, can
help relieve stress and increase positive emotions. Despite all these positives,
people rarely make time to indulge in creating art. <br/>Graphite Stories is an organisation
that finds ways to make art accessible to people.<br/>
B.L Kavyashree, the founder of Graphite Stories is an artist herself, having painted
and drawn her way through her adolescent years. Initially, she started Graphite
Stories as an Instagram page where she could showcase and sell her art, and take
orders on commission. Eventually however, Kavya realised that there was more she
could do with the platform. <br/>
While still in college, she and her friend, Sharan started approaching schools and
colleges in the name of Graphite stories, looking for opportunities to conduct
workshops for students that not only encourage
creativity, but also stimulate artistic expression among individuals.<br/>
In addition to various projects, Graphite Stories also conduct art competitions
to help raise awareness about pressing issues. With backing from multiple
corporates, the organisation provides art supplies required for competitors, allowing
those who cannot afford to attend such competitions the opportunity to do so.</center>

							paper bag making were conducted simultaneously to cater to the plethora of age groups that were present on that day. Origami for kids included paper swan, variety of paper flowers, 
							ninja star and so on. The paper bag-making workshop was divided into two sessions; one was a painting session that was done in association with YouVa. 
							It is a stationery brand of Navneet designed keeping the youth of India in mind. The other session was the paper bag making session to encourage citizens to move 
							from plastic covers to paper bags.

							<b>Beautifying Bangalore</b><br/>
							It is an ongoing project where certain prime locations are chosen and the walls of which are painted in order to beautify Bangalore. The latest being, 
							Nrupatunga Road Underpass in front of St. Martha’s Hospital, that was infested with unwanted posters and notices. The wall was cleaned and beautifully 
							painted by young artists, one of them done by Graphite Stories. This was as part of a CSR project of MyPeriodStory.com to addresses the universal stigma 
							about menstruation. Note: The painting above was only a part of the entire painting project.
